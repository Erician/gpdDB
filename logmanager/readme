CUrrently, we don't use the transaction, just applying checkpoint

Checkpoints are writed to the log file, when the gpdDB first start or the dirty pages are flushing into 
the disk. We try to record as many checkpoints as possible, because it can be used to reduce the recovery 
time when some failures happen, such as system failure, media failure, etc..

the format of a log record:

offset:         ____________________
x              |LSN                 |
x+8            |--------------------|
               |operation           |
x+9            |--------------------|
               |blkNum              |
x+17           |--------------------|
               |key len             |
x+19           |--------------------|
               |key string          |
x+19+keyLen    |--------------------|
               |value len           |
x+21+keyLen    |--------------------|
               |value string        |
               |____________________|

NOTE:
LSN is log sequence number, start from 0; the following is all the operations:
PUT, DELETE, ALLOCATE
ALLOCATE is to allocate a new blank node, without key and value, so whose keyLen and valueLen is all ZERO.
